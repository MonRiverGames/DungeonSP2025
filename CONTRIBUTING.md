# Contributing Guidelines for Dungeon Crawler Project

## **Getting Started**
Thank you for contributing to the Dungeon Crawler project! To maintain a clean and organized repository, please follow these guidelines.

### **1. Fork the Repository**
1. Navigate to the main repository on GitHub.
2. Click the **Fork** button to create a copy under your GitHub account.
3. Clone the forked repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/DungeonCrawler-Template.git
   cd DungeonCrawler-Template
   ```

### **2. Branching Strategy**
- Always create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.
- Use the following naming conventions:
  - `feature/feature-name` (e.g., `feature/combat-system`)
  - `bugfix/issue-description` (e.g., `bugfix/fix-player-movement`)
- To create and switch to a new branch:
  ```sh
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  ```

### **3. Making Changes & Committing**
- Keep your code **modular and well-documented**.
- Run tests before committing to ensure stability.
- Write meaningful commit messages:
  ```sh
  git commit -m "Added enemy attack system"
  ```
- Push your branch to GitHub:
  ```sh
  git push origin feature/your-feature-name
  ```

### **4. Submitting a Pull Request (PR)**
1. Go to the main repository and open a **Pull Request (PR)**.
2. Select your branch and compare it with `main`.
3. Provide a clear **title** and **description** explaining your changes.
4. Wait for a review before merging.
5. Make changes if requested and **ensure there are no merge conflicts**.

### **5. Code Review Process**
- All PRs must be reviewed by at least one other contributor before merging.
- The review will check:
